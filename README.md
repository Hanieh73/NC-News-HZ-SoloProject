# Front End React App: NC News

Welcome to NC News, a front-end React application that showcases my skills and knowledge gained during week 9 of the Northcoders' software engineering bootcamp course. This solo project demonstrates my proficiency in various React subjects, including React DOM Manipulation, React Routing, Optimistic Rendering, and Error Handling.

NC News interacts with the back-end RESTful API that I developed during week six of the course. You can find the details of the API on GitHub: [HZ-NC-News-Backend](https://github.com/Hanieh73/HZ-NC-News-Backend/tree/main).

To access and explore my project, please visit the following link: [hz-nc-news.netlify.app](https://hz-nc-news.netlify.app/). The project is hosted on Netlify, providing seamless access to its functionality.

Functionality:

1. Home and Topic Routes:
   - Upon loading, the demo requests a list of articles from the API.

2. Article Details:
   - By clicking on each article, you can view its title, picture, context, topic, date created, author, and comments.
   - You have the ability to vote for an article, limited to one vote per user.

Error Handling:
- In the case of bad route errors, the relevant 400/404 page is displayed.
- API errors will result in the appropriate API error status code and message being shown to the user.

This project doesn't stop here, and I have plans to add more functionality to it in the future. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to enhance NC News with additional features and improvements.

I hope you enjoy exploring NC News and experiencing its functionalities. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out. Happy browsing!
